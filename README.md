# GreenLens – Track, Earn, and Give Back to the Planet 🌱

GreenLens is a smart sustainability platform that helps users track, verify, and reduce their environmental impact. By logging daily activities like travel, energy use, and shopping habits, users earn Green Tokens for verified eco-friendly actions.

🌟 Core Features

Activity Tracking: Log daily habits and upload bills or receipts, auto-processed via Google Cloud Document AI.

ML Verification: An XGBoost model ensures fair and accurate token distribution.

Blockchain Rewards: Verified actions mint Green Tokens on the Sepolia testnet, ensuring transparent tracking.

Redeem or Donate: Use tokens to buy eco-products or donate to verified NGOs — all recorded on-chain.

AI Assistant: An OpenAI-powered chatbot helps users log actions, answer questions, and suggest greener choices.

Impact Dashboard: A clean React + TailwindCSS dashboard displays your carbon impact, token balance, and leaderboard rank.
